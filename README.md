# INFO ON NEW SCHOOL YEAR

## For year 12s

Over the past 6 months, we have been running  weekly events that last for around 1 hour each, which will now be run from 5:00 to 6:00 on Teams (You can either email me and I'll add you to the team or you can use this link: o45hry9). Some of the resources for the events we held are in this repo. In the past, we have held programming workshops, tutorials, competitions, talks and project presentations, so if there is anything you would like to take part in specifically, or if you are interested in any of the contents of this repo and would like to find out more, feel free to email me!

The plan is to begin the academic year with a set of talks/tutorials on the unsupervised object detection algorithm we wrote for the [robotic arm project](https://github.com/Joseph-Rance/Com-Soc-robotic-arm). If you would like to attend, The tutorials will be on Thursdays from 5:00 to 6:00 on teams (code: o45hry9), starting on the 24th. Hopefully you will find the content interesting, and, if you want to follow along, will be able to get some functioning code working by the end.

## For year 13s

As we took a break from doing weekly tutorials to do some programming competitions and the robotic arm, we plan on going back to doing some tutorials again. We'll most likely be running from 5 to 6 on Thursday evenings (first session on the 24th) on MS Teams. We'll kick off the academic year with a tutorial on the algorithms we wrote for unsupervised object detection for the robotic arm. It will probably take more that one session to finish the tutorial, so the tutorial will span a couple of weeks. Hopefully everyone will find it interesting, and I'll try to include some resources on other techniques we considered for if anyone wants to read further into the topic. For anyone who isn't up to date with the robotic arm project, we are still working on it, but the work will be done outside of com soc meetings from now on as a lot of the computing work has been done. Once it is finished, we'll hopefully be able to do a demo of it in one of the sessions, although that won't be any time soon as we can't order parts for a while due to Covid. As always, if anyone has any ideas for things to do after the tutorial, please send them to me!

UPDATE 14/09/2020: WE NOW HAVE A TEAM ON MS TEAMS! MESSAGE ME ON DISCORD OR EMAIL ME IF YOU WANT TO BE ADDED
UPDATE 17/09/2020: YOU CAN USE THIS CODE TO GET ONTO TEAMS: o45hry9

## WebGL/OpenGL presentation

To change the image, download the folder called 'Joe Cube'. Then, upload the file you want on the cube and rename it to 'joe5.png'. Then run 'index.html'

Thanks to Peter Conway for 'writing' the code for and doing a talk on *WebGL*

## Rust Presentation

The folder called 'Rust Presentation' contains the PowerPoint used as well as the C++ and Rust code used in the demonstration. To run the C++ you'll need a compiler such as MVSC (which can be included in Visual Studio) or Clang. To run the Rust code you'll need the rustc compiler. If you don't want to use those, the repl.it links are here: 

- C++: https://repl.it/@KashParty/JoesClubC
- Rust: https://repl.it/@KashParty/JoesClubRust

~Our greatest gratitude to Pratyaksh Sharma for enlightnening us about a superior programming language in a truly magnificent talk.~

*Thanks Prat*

## Maximise Presentation

The folder called 'Maximise' contains the PowerPoint used as well as the python code used in the demonstration. Please note that the python code has been altered to protect users' privacy so will not function, however the machine learning bit should still be functional if you want to look at it.

I'm not going to stoop so low as to thank myself.

## React Tutorial

The folder called react contains the whole folder from CSB of the react tutorial. If you just want the code to use in CSB, it is in SRC/APP.JS.

Thanks to Isaac for the tutorial

**Thanks to pratyaksh also for doing a talk on his time at villier's park and his NLP project he did there**

## UNIX presentation

Thanks to Peter for going another great presentation about UNIX, its history and how to use it, in our first online talk. You can find the presentation in the UNIX folder.

Here's a screenshot of Peter's demonstration:

## Congratulations to Alex and Akilan for winning the Python v C# debate
## Congratulations to Mr. Walser and Peter for winning the Linux v Windows debate

## Machine learning tutorial

I hope everyone enjoyed the Machine learning tutorial and that it helped you to get started with ML if you are new to it or gave you a new perspective on it if you have done similar projects before.

Here is a link to the Colab file if you need it:

## Unity tutorial

Thanks to Ryan for doing the tutorial on Unity. We rushed through the last bit a little, so you can find the finished project in the files of this repo.

## Game making competition

Congrats to team AARH for winning the game making competittion. Exe files for the games can be found in the "game making competition" folder of this repo. Other info about the scoring and links can be found in #info in the discord server. 

## Pratyaksh's Pathfinding Project

You can read the article at https://bitbybit.web.app. 

You can access the presentation (with controls enabled obviously) at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTD8B4f57dOqi_v1VhW8SehQ7grQ8PeXxPYWWqyYTH0DBq2ou01QYjg9OkyQfmUqMRVGbmQjoSxa2fN/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000

There are two pieces of code that are in the "pathfinding_talk" folder of this repo. There is the original code for the simulation and there is the complete code for the coin change dynamic programming program.

## First Programming Challenge

Congrats to Team GONK and thanks to Pratyaksh for making a great wbesite:
https://comsoc.web.app/competitions

More info can be found on Discord and on the email thread

## Second Programming Challenge

Congratulations to everyone who took part and came up with some amazing solutions. Thanks again to Pratyaksh for updating the website linked above

## Robotic Arm

We are currently making a robotic arm in Computing Soc. We are using a new Repo for the code, which can be found at: https://github.com/Joseph-Rance/Com-Soc-robotic-arm
