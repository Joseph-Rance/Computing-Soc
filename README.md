## Rust Presentation

The folder called 'Rust Presentation' contains the PowerPoint used as well as the C++ and Rust code used in the demonstration. To run the C++ you'll need a compiler such as MVSC (which can be included in Visual Studio) or Clang. To run the Rust code you'll need the rustc compiler. If you don't want to use those, the repl.it links are here: 

- C++: https://repl.it/@KashParty/JoesClubC

Our greatest gratitude to Pratyaksh Sharma for enlightnening us about a superior programming language in a truly magnificent talk.
