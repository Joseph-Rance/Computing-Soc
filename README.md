If anyone wants a talk on something or would like to do a talk plz email me (Joseph Rance)

## WebGL/OpenGL presentation

To change the image, download the folder called 'Joe Cube'. Then, upload the file you want on the cube and rename it to 'joe5.png'. Then run 'index.html'

Thanks to Peter Conway for 'writing' the code for and doing a talk on *WebGL*

## Rust Presentation

The folder called 'Rust Presentation' contains the PowerPoint used as well as the C++ and Rust code used in the demonstration. To run the C++ you'll need a compiler such as MVSC (which can be included in Visual Studio) or Clang. To run the Rust code you'll need the rustc compiler. If you don't want to use those, the repl.it links are here: 

- C++: https://repl.it/@KashParty/JoesClubC
- Rust: https://repl.it/@KashParty/JoesClubRust

~Our greatest gratitude to Pratyaksh Sharma for enlightnening us about a superior programming language in a truly magnificent talk.~

*Thanks Prat*

## Maximise Presentation

The folder called 'Maximise' contains the PowerPoint used as well as the python code used in the demonstration. Please note that the python code has been altered to protect users' privacy so will not function, however the machine learning bit should still be functional if you want to look at it.

I'm not going to stoop so low as to thank myself.

## React Tutorial

The folder called react contains the whole folder from CSB of the react tutorial. If you just want the code to use in CSB, it is in SRC/APP.JS.

Thanks to Isaac for the tutorial

**Thanks to pratyaksh also for doing a talk on his time at villier's park and his NLP project he did there**

## UNIX presentation

Thanks to Peter for going another great presentation about UNIX, its history and how to use it, in our first online talk. You can find the presentation in the UNIX folder.

Here's a screenshot of Peter's demonstration:

## Congratulations to Alex and Akilan for winning the Python v C# debate
## Congratulations to Mr. Walser and Peter for winning the Linux v Windows debate

## Machine learning tutorial

I hope everyone enjoyed the Machine learning tutorial and that it helped you to get started with ML if you are new to it or gave you a new perspective on it if you have done similar projects before.

Here is a link to the Colab file if you need it:
